An R interface to the [OpenStreetMap API v0.6](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/API_v0.6) for fetching and saving raw
geodata from/to the OpenStreetMap database. This package allows access to OSM maps data as well as map notes, GPS
traces, changelogs, and users data. To access OSM map data for purposes other than editing or exploring the history
of the objects see [Related packages](#related-packages).

You are responsible for following the [API Usage Policy](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/api/).
You can modify the user agent of the requests by setting the option `osmapir.user_agent`:

```r
options(osmapir.user_agent = "my new user agent")
```

Respect and follow the
[standards and conventions](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing_Standards_and_Conventions) of the OpenStreetMap
community. If you plan to do automated edits, check the 
[Automated Edits code of conduct](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Automated_Edits_code_of_conduct).


## Installation

To install latest CRAN version:

``` r
install.packages("osmapiR")
```

You can install the development version of osmapiR from [GitHub](https://github.com) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/osmapiR") # Without vignettes

## With vignettes (also accessible at https://docs.ropensci.org/osmapiR/ > Articles)
# install.packages("rmarkdown") # Needed to build vignettes.
remotes::install_github("ropensci/osmapiR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


## Get started

For an overview of the functions, check `?osmapiR-package` or the
[web](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmapiR/reference/index.html).

For basic examples, check
[`vignette("osmapiR", package="osmapiR")`](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmapiR/articles/osmapiR.html).


## Related packages

* [osmdata](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmdata) implements the Overpass API to query data from OSM.
* [osmextract](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmextract) matches, downloads, converts, and imports bulk OSM data
  (`.pbf` files).
* [OpenStreetMap](https://cran.r-project.org/package=OpenStreetMap) accesses high resolution raster maps using the
  OpenStreetMap protocol.
  
`osmapiR` is the only package to access other OSM data than the maps data (map notes, GPS traces, changelogs and
users). It is also useful to get the history of the OSM objects and is the only package that allows editing and
upload any kind of data.

To access OSM map data for purposes other than editing or exploring the history of objects, it may be better to use
other packages that implement the Overpass API ([osmdata](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmdata)) or
that works with `.pbf` files ([osmextract](https://cran.r-project.org/package=osmextract)).
